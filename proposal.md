# Project Proposal: AWS Nova-Powered Mobile Money Fraud Detection Platform for Ghana

## Executive Summary

Mobile money is the backbone of Ghana's financial inclusion, but it is under increasing threat from sophisticated fraudsters. Nearly 8% of mobile money users have fallen victim to digital fraud, with losses in 2023 alone surpassing GHS 346 million (~$28.5 million USD) and rising every year. 

This project proposes a robust, multimodal fraud detection platform powered by AWS Nova and Amazon Fraud Detector, offering real-time protection for consumers, financial agents, and telecom providers across Ghana.

## Problem Statement

Mobile money fraud in Ghana has reached crisis levels:

- Over 65% of users have been targeted or victimized by fraud attempts [3]
- Social engineering, SIM swap attacks, API exploits, and deepfake voice fraud are rampant and increasingly sophisticated [2][3]
- Regulatory enforcement and public awareness lag behind innovation, and current anti-fraud systems are reactive, siloed, and slow to adapt [4][3]

## Solution Overview

The proposed solution is a full-stack ecosystem combining AWS AI/ML services, serverless architecture, and inclusive, user-first apps and SDKs to prevent, detect, and respond to mobile money fraud in real time.

## Key Deliverables
### 1. NestJS API Backend
- Handles authentication and securely receives mobile money transaction data (text, images, voice)
- Integrates with AWS Nova and Amazon Fraud Detector for real-time fraud scoring
- Connects with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 for scalability and resilience
- Provides APIs for all frontends and third-party partners
- Implements feedback/retraining for continuous AI improvement

### 2. Flutter Mobile App
- Lets users scan and forward SMS and other transaction data to the backend
- Background SMS scanning and permission-based notification to instantly warn users about fraudulent messages
- Interactive verification for users to report, validate, or challenge the AI's fraud decision

### 3. Web Dashboard
- Real-time analytics on fraud cases: types, volumes, success rates, trends
- Grouping/classification of fraud types, with filters for agents, regions, providers, etc.
- Visualization and reporting with AWS QuickSight, plus case management for operational teams and authorities

### 4. NPM Package and SDK
- Enables network providers and fintech partners to integrate fraud detection into their own SMS or USSD workflows
- Avoids fraud at the telecom gateway—before scams ever reach user devices
- Provides robust documentation and sample integrations

## Unique Winning Features
- **Multimodal Fraud Detection**: Leverages text, imagery, voice, and device data for high-accuracy detection, using AWS Nova's latest foundation models [3]
- **Local Language Support**: Ghanaian languages are natively supported in alerts, reporting, and interaction
- **Serverless, Low-Cost Infrastructure**: Scalable AWS Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, Step Functions, and DynamoDB
- **Inclusive Access**: Both smartphone and USSD-based solutions ensure reach to urban and rural populations
- **Live User Engagement**: Real-time, multilingual fraud alerts, with user ability to interact (e.g., voice/image confirmation)
- **Agent Collaboration Tools**: Special dashboards and review queues for investigation by financial agents and law enforcement
- **Real-Time Automation**: Event-driven workflows automate fraud scoring, notifications, and escalation

## Architecture & Workflow
1. **User Receives SMS/Transaction**: Phone app reads and/or scans transaction as it arrives
2. **Message Forwarded to Backend**: Sent as text, image, or voice
3. **AWS Nova/Amazon Fraud Detector Invoked**: Message scored in real time
4. **Fraud Assessment Returned**: Result sent to app (and/or partner system) instantly
5. **User/Agent Notified**: Alert in local language, classified by confidence/severity
6. **Dashboards/Summary Data Updated**: Statistics and case management available for operational teams
7. **Feedback Loop Supports Retraining**: User, agent, and case resolutions used to retrain or update fraud models

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS (Node.js), AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Step Functions, EventBridge, Amazon Fraud Detector, AWS Nova API
- **Mobile App**: Flutter, platform SMS APIs, background task handling
- **Dashboard**: React/Angular + AWS QuickSight or OpenSearch
- **SDK/NPM Package**: JavaScript/TypeScript, well-documented for external adoption

## Impact & Measurement
- Reduced fraud incidents among Ghanaian mobile money users
- Increased trust and adoption of digital financial services
- Insightful, actionable fraud intelligence for telecoms and regulators
- Demonstrated scalable, cost-effective AI/ML solution for Africa's financial ecosystem

## Roadmap & Milestones
1. **MVP Delivery (4 weeks)**: API, mobile app (scan + SMS), basic dashboard, AWS integration
2. **Partner & SDK Integration (8 weeks)**: NPM package, telco/fintech pilot
3. **Full Multimodal, Multilingual Support (12 weeks)**: Add voice/image, local language interfaces
4. **Feedback, Monitoring, & Model Retraining (14+ weeks)**: Optimize based on live results

## Conclusion
This project directly addresses Ghana's mobile money fraud crisis by leveraging AWS's most advanced AI, making fraud detection accessible, automated, and collaborative for users, agents, and enterprises. Its technical quality, scalability, and local impact fulfill all criteria for a leading solution in the AWS AI Hackathon.

- **Real-Time**: Live alerts stream, alerts/minute, latency, ingestion health
- **Geography**: Ghana map (region/district), heatmap; drilldowns
- **Providers & Channels**: Comparative bars, trend lines, latency breakdown

#### Key Metrics & Graphs

- **Total transactions**: Count of all processed transactions/messages in selected period
- **Flagged transactions**: Count and rate = flagged / total
- **Confirmed fraud cases**: Count of alerts confirmed as fraud by ops or user feedback
- **Fraud capture rate (recall)**: confirmed_fraud_caught / total_confirmed_fraud
- **False positive rate (FPR)**: non_fraud_flagged / total_non_fraud
- **Precision (alert quality)**: confirmed_fraud_caught / total_flagged
- **Estimated losses prevented (GHS)**: sum(estimated_loss_per_txn for confirmed fraud caught)
- **Actual losses incurred (GHS)**: sum(loss for fraud that escaped detection)
- **Net fraud reduction (%)**: (baseline_loss − current_loss) / baseline_loss
